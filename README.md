## Physical gear
- **Mouse** - Zelotes C-18 Vertical. Only replaced the excellent [SteelSeries Rival 500](https://steelseries.com/gaming-mice/rival-500) to reduce wrist strain. Oodles of physical buttons and doesn't compromise ergonomics. [See my detailed review here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MouseReview/comments/8jddq0/steelseries_rival_500_review_compared_to_logitech/) Retired the Logitech G502 in May 2018.
- **Keyboard** - Wireless Logitech K520 (comes as combo with mouse which I never use). Practically placed media keys, damn cheap and battery lasts forever.
- **Headphones** - [Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro](https://www.beyerdynamic.com) 80ohm headphones - closed reference headphones with soft pads & readily available replacement pads/parts (Beyerdynamic rarely discontinues models unlike brands... like Audio Technica).
- **Ballpoint pen** - [Zebra F-701 ballpoint Pen](https://www.zebrapen.com/product/f-701-ball-point-retractable/)
- **Measuring tape** - Used way more often than one would think!
- **Label printer** - Ancient [Dymo](http://www.dymo.com) LabelWriter, any old model is fine without DRM.
- **Monitors** - one in landscape (1920x1080), another in in portrait (1200x1920). Can't go wrong with Dell.
- **Bluetooth earbuds** - Anker SoundBuds Slim with custom eartips. Cheap, good frequency response and isolation. 

## Windows 7 only
- [**WizMouse**](http://antibody-software.com/web/software/software/wizmouse-makes-your-mouse-wheel-work-on-the-window-under-the-mouse/) - Allows mouse wheel to work on window under the cursor, even if it's out of focus.
- [**VirtualCloneDrive**](https://www.elby.ch/en/products/vcd.html) - Load ISO files directly, newer versions of Windows have this built-in.

## Retired
- [**SignNow**](https://www.signnow.com/) - E-signing service, Was only worth it due to grandfathered pricing. Replaced by Microsoft Edge.
- [**Laravel Valet (Windows port)**](https://github.com/cretueusebiu/valet-windows) - PHP/Laravel development environment. Replaced by something terrible.
- [**Rainmeter**](https://www.rainmeter.net/) - Custom desktop widgets. I use it for my [World Clock](https://github.com/alystair/rainmeterWorldclock) and edited version of [Do I need a Jacket 2.0](https://flyinghyrax.deviantart.com/art/Do-I-Need-a-Jacket-2-0-beta-2016-04-10-494721790). I rarely if ever end up looking at my desktop. No complaints, just no longer of personal use.
- [**AquaSnap Pro**](https://www.nurgo-software.com/products/aquasnap) - (Windows 10) Tiling window manager. Snap, dock & tile windows. Windows 11 built-in management is sufficient.
- **Dropbox** - Cloud storage, transitioned away because the free version has become limiting (3 device maximum, constant annoying notifications) and it consumes more resources than OneDrive.
- [**Cmder**](http://cmder.net) - replaced by Windows Terminal. Command prompt manager. Setup in quasi-Quake console mode.
- [**Sandboxie**](https://www.sandboxie.com) - Isolate potentially pesky/untrusted applications, to be retired once Windows 10 built-in sandboxing UX has improved.
- [**sWeather**](http://www.dcmembers.com/skwire/download/sweather/) - replaced by TrayWeather. Data source no longer exists. Weather reporting, no fuss with plenty of customization options. Pre-dates Win 10's broken mess by at least 8 years :P
- [**Audio Switcher**](Change%20Audio.ahk) - replaced by SoundSwitch. File available for reference.
- [**KatMouse**](http://ehiti.de/katmouse/) - Scroll unfocused windows. Replaced by [WizMouse](http://antibody-software.com/web/software/software/wizmouse-makes-your-mouse-wheel-work-on-the-window-under-the-mouse/).
- **SpeedFan** - Monitors voltages, fan speeds and temperatures and check drive SMART status. Not updated actively so it has been mostly replaced by HWInfo
- **ScreenToGif** - replaced by LiceCAP. Editor UI is nice but the exported gifs are large.
- [**DisplayFusion**](https://www.displayfusion.com/) - Advanced wallpaper manager and misc. tweaks. No longer change my wallpaper frequently enough to care, although I do rarely use it to generate multi-monitor wallpaper.
- [**iRotate**](https://www.entechtaiwan.com/util/irotate.shtm) - Screen rotation hotkeys. I now have two monitors in both portrait & landscape, so I have no need for it anymore.
- [**WebMon**](https://alternativeto.net/software/webmon/) - discontinued web page monitoring program, used it for checking web comics for updates. Likely to be replaced by a Chrome extension.
- [**MediaMonkey**](http://www.mediamonkey.com/) - Absolutely incredible media library software. Highly customizable. When my media disks and backup failed catastrophically years ago I never had the time to get things back in order. Maybe I will someday, I enjoyed rating music I listened to on a 0-5 scale which online services can't do.
- **FullContact Address Book** - Android contact manager, now crapware. AVOID.
