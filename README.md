# My productivity stack
My productivity stack for workflow transcendence. Ordered by blend of personal usage/general usefulness.

Have suggestions or alternatives? Submit an issue, especially for the following: Comic viewer (zips), image viewer, general file explorer, SFTP client, Adobe Fireworks.

## Software
- [**ClipX**](https://bluemars.org/clipx/) - Clipboard manager. Add sticky & color picker (grab hex code colors from under mouse) plugins. Development discontinued many years ago but still works *extremely* well and beats Window 10's built-in clipboard manager.
- [**Everything**](https://www.voidtools.com/) - locate files and folders by name instantly. Totally replaced my use of built-in search.
- [**TrayWeather**](https://github.com/FelixdelasPozas/TrayWeather) - Taskbar weather reporting, no fuss with some customization.
- [**Greenshot**](http://getgreenshot.org/) - screenshot power tool, can edit/blur and upload directly to image sharing sites.
- [**Notepad++**](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) - General text/code editor, check [##Development](#development) for my current IDE.
- [**KeePass 2**](https://keepass.info/) - Password/private data manager (if not using Chrome's)
- [**Process Explorer**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer) - Task manager for power users, drop-in replacement.
- [**IrfanView**](https://www.irfanview.com/) - Image viewer, initally released in 1996 and still in active development.
- [**Negative Screen**](https://zerowidthjoiner.net/negativescreen) - invert or dim your screen for those late night code sessions.
- [**CDisplayEx**](http://www.cdisplayex.com/) - Image viewer for zip and comics \***WARNING**\* Official installer is full of crapware, you must locate a clean copy elsewhere.
- [**SoundSwitch**](https://github.com/Belphemur/SoundSwitch/) - Multiple audio outputs? Quickly switch default audio devices.
- [**Bulk Rename Utility**](http://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk) - advanced file renamer

#### [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/) Scripts
- [**Display Blanker**](Display%20Blanker.ahk) - smooth display blanking via custom hotkey toggle. Meant for OLED monitors when you wish to leave your computer on won't be using the display. Turns off on mouse movement and any keyboard press.
- [**Launch Calculator**](Launch%20Calculator.ahk) - allows only a single instance of a calculator to be launched. Bound to calc key.

## Media / Creation
- [**MPV**](http://mpv.io) - Media/video player, extremely customizable. Integrated with YoutubeDL for streaming content.
- [**XMPlay**](http://support.xmplay.com/) - Tiny audio player. Grab [this skin](http://support.xmplay.com/files_view.php?file_id=557) as the default design is ugly. It also plays [old school tracker music](https://modarchive.org) and has plugins for game console sound files!
- [**Adobe Fireworks**](https://www.adobe.com/ca/products/fireworks.html) - Discontinued bitmap/vector editing tool. The ultimate compromise between Photoshop and Illustrator. RIP Macromedia :(
- [**Audacity**](https://www.audacityteam.org) - Free & open source multi-track audio editing/recording. Mostly use Adobe Audition.
- [**Adobe Audition**](https://www.audacityteam.org) - Defacto audio editing/recording suite. Spectral editing is quite impressive.
- [**LiceCAP**](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) - Customizable screen recording... to animated GIFs! It's output is quite optimal and has beaten all newer competitors so far!
- [**OBS Studio**](https://obsproject.com/) - Streaming and screen/video recording software, open source.

## Support/Diagnostic
- [**WizTree**](http://antibody-software.com) - Disk space visualizer, stupid fast.
- [**HWiNFO**](https://hwinfo.com) - Comprehensive hardware analysis/monitoring
- [**Driver Identifier**](https://www.driveridentifier.com/) - find newer system drivers if absolutely necessary.
- [**CPU-Z**](https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html) - Hardware identification
- [**Process Monitor**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) - shows real-time file system, registry and process/thread activity. Not for the faint of heart. I recommend the checking out the entire [Sysinternals utilities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/) index for the various tools.
- [**Device Cleanup Tool**](https://www.uwe-sieber.de/misc_tools_e.html) - Remove non-present devices from Windows Device management

## Development
- [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - IDE
- [**WinSCP**](https://winscp.net) - SFTP client
- [**Laravel Valet (Windows port)**](https://github.com/cretueusebiu/valet-windows) - PHP/Laravel development environment.

## Personal taste
- [**Dropbox**](https://www.dropbox.com) - Cloud storage, although I'm slowly transitioning to OneDrive/Business because the free version has become limiting (3 device maximum, constant annoying notifications) and it consumes more resources than OneDrive.
- [**qBittorrent**](https://www.qbittorrent.org) - Extremely customizable torrenting application.
- [**Rainmeter**](https://www.rainmeter.net/) - Custom desktop widgets. I use it for my [World Clock](https://github.com/alystair/rainmeterWorldclock) and edited version of [Do I need a Jacket 2.0](https://flyinghyrax.deviantart.com/art/Do-I-Need-a-Jacket-2-0-beta-2016-04-10-494721790)

## Online services
- [**Spotify Premium**](http://spotify.com) - Music/podcast service. Premium because I hate ads and want to support artists.
- [**YouTube Premium**](https://www.youtube.com/premium) - I feel legally adblocking and supporting a service is critical to its long term sustainablity... with the drama that is happening on the platform maybe there will be a different option.
- [**SignNow**](https://www.signnow.com/) - E-signing service, Still with them due to grandfathered pricing, might build my own if forced to pay full price.

## Android apps
- [Blackberry Hub](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blackberry.hub) / [Calendar](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blackberry.calendar) / [Contacts](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blackberry.contacts)
- [Today Weather](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mobi.lockdown.weather) - passive weather status in status bar, notifications, etc.
- [Sync for Reddit](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.laurencedawson.reddit_sync) - Reddit client, plenty of customization options and a major daily distraction! :)

## Physical gear
- **Headphones** - [Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro](https://www.beyerdynamic.com) 80ohm headphones - closed reference headphones with soft pads & readily available replacement pads/parts (Beyerdynamic rarely discontinues models unlike brands... like Audio Technica).
- **Mouse** - [SteelSeries Rival 500](https://steelseries.com/gaming-mice/rival-500). Oodles of physical buttons and doesn't compromise ergonomics. [See my detailed review here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MouseReview/comments/8jddq0/steelseries_rival_500_review_compared_to_logitech/) This mouse retired my Logitech G502 in May 2018.
- **Ballpoint pen** - [Zebra F-701 ballpoint Pen](https://www.zebrapen.com/product/f-701-ball-point-retractable/)
- **Measuring tape** - Used way more often than one would think!
- **Label printer** - Ancient [Dymo](http://www.dymo.com) LabelWriter, any model is fine.
- **Monitors** - one in landscape (1920x1080), another in in portrait (1200x1920). Can't go wrong with Dell.
- **Keyboard** - Wireless Logitech K520 (comes as combo with mouse which I never use). Practically placed media keys and pretty cheap. 
- **Bluetooth earbuds** - Anker SoundBuds Slim with custom eartips. Cheap, good frequency response and isolation. 

## Windows 7 only
- [**WizMouse**](http://antibody-software.com/web/software/software/wizmouse-makes-your-mouse-wheel-work-on-the-window-under-the-mouse/) - Allows mouse wheel to work on window under the cursor, even if it's out of focus.
- [**VirtualCloneDrive**](https://www.elby.ch/en/products/vcd.html) - Load ISO files directly, newer versions of Windows have this built-in.

## Retired
- [**AquaSnap Pro**](https://www.nurgo-software.com/products/aquasnap) - (Windows 10) Tiling window manager. Snap, dock & tile windows. Windows 11 built-in management is sufficient.
- [**Cmder**](http://cmder.net) - replaced by Windows Terminal. Command prompt manager. Setup in quasi-Quake console mode.
- [**Sandboxie**](https://www.sandboxie.com) - Isolate potentially pesky/untrusted applications, to be retired once Windows 10 built-in sandboxing UX has improved.
- [**sWeather**](http://www.dcmembers.com/skwire/download/sweather/) - replaced by TrayWeather. Data source no longer exists. Weather reporting, no fuss with plenty of customization options. Pre-dates Win 10's broken mess by at least 8 years :P
- [**Audio Switcher**](Change%20Audio.ahk) - replaced by SoundSwitch. File available for reference.
- [**KatMouse**](http://ehiti.de/katmouse/) - Scroll unfocused windows. Replaced by [WizMouse](http://antibody-software.com/web/software/software/wizmouse-makes-your-mouse-wheel-work-on-the-window-under-the-mouse/).
- **SpeedFan** - Monitors voltages, fan speeds and temperatures and check drive SMART status. Not updated actively so it has been mostly replaced by HWInfo
- **ScreenToGif** - replaced by LiceCAP. Editor UI is nice but the exported gifs are large.
- [**DisplayFusion**](https://www.displayfusion.com/) - Advanced wallpaper manager and misc. tweaks. No longer change my wallpaper frequently enough to care, although I do rarely use it to generate multi-monitor wallpaper.
- [**iRotate**](https://www.entechtaiwan.com/util/irotate.shtm) - Screen rotation hotkeys. I now have two monitors in both portrait & landscape, so I have no need for it anymore.
- [**WebMon**](https://alternativeto.net/software/webmon/) - discontinued web page monitoring program, used it for checking web comics for updates. Likely to be replaced by a Chrome extension.
- [**MediaMonkey**](http://www.mediamonkey.com/) - Absolutely incredible media library software. Highly customizable. When my media disks and backup failed catastrophically years ago I never had the time to get things back in order. Maybe I will someday, I enjoyed rating music I listened to on a 0-5 scale which online services can't do.
- **FullContact Address Book** - Android contact manager, now crapware. Avoid.
