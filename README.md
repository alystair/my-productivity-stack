# My productivity stack
My productivity stack for workflow transcendence. Ordered by blend of personal usage/general usefulness.

Have suggestions or alternatives? Submit an issue, especially for the following: Comic viewer (zips), image viewer, general file explorer, SFTP client, Adobe Fireworks.

## Software
- [**ClipX**](https://bluemars.org/clipx/) - Clipboard manager. Add sticky & color picker (grab hex code colors from under mouse) plugins. Development discontinued many years ago but still works *extremely* well and beats Window 10's built-in clipboard manager.
- [**Everything**](https://www.voidtools.com/) - locate files and folders by name instantly. Totally replaced my use of built-in search.
- [**AquaSnap Pro**](https://www.nurgo-software.com/products/aquasnap) - Tiling window manager. Snap, dock & tile windows. 
- [**sWeather**](http://www.dcmembers.com/skwire/download/sweather/) - Taskbar weather reporting, no fuss with plenty of customization options.
- [**Greenshot**](http://getgreenshot.org/) - screenshot power tool, can edit/blur and upload directly to image sharing sites.
- [**Notepad++**](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) - General text/code editor, check [##Development](#development) for my current IDE.
- [**KeePass 2**](https://keepass.info/) - Password/private data manager (if not using Chrome's)
- [**Process Explorer**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer) - Task manager for power users, drop-in replacement.
- [**IrfanView**](https://www.irfanview.com/) - Image viewer, initally released in 1996 and still in active development.
- [**Negative Screen**](https://zerowidthjoiner.net/negativescreen) - invert or dim your screen for those late night code sessions.
- [**CDisplayEx**](http://www.cdisplayex.com/) - Image viewer for zip and comics \***WARNING**\* Official installer is full of crapware, you must locate a clean copy elsewhere.
- [**SoundSwitch**](https://github.com/Belphemur/SoundSwitch/) - Multiple audio outputs? Quickly switch default audio devices.
- [**Bulk Rename Utility**](http://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk) - advanced file renamer

#### [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/) Scripts
- [**Launch Calculator**](Launch%20Calculator.ahk) - allows only a single instance of a calculator to be launched. Bound to calc key.

## Media / Creation
- [**MPV**](http://mpv.io) - Media/video player, extremely customizable. Integrated with YoutubeDL for streaming content.
- [**XMPlay**](http://support.xmplay.com/) - Tiny audio player. Grab [this skin](http://support.xmplay.com/files_view.php?file_id=557) as the default design is ugly. It also plays [old school tracker music](https://modarchive.org) and has plugins for game console sound files!
- [**Adobe Fireworks**](https://www.adobe.com/ca/products/fireworks.html) - Discontinued bitmap/vector editing tool. The ultimate compromise between Photoshop and Illustrator. RIP Macromedia :(
- [**Audacity**](https://www.audacityteam.org) - Free & open source multi-track audio editing/recording. Mostly use Adobe Audition.
- [**Adobe Audition**](https://www.audacityteam.org) - Defacto audio editing/recording suite. Spectral editing is quite impressive.
- [**LiceCAP**](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) - Customizable screen recording... to animated GIFs! It's output is quite optimal and has beaten all newer competitors so far!
- [**OBS Studio**](https://obsproject.com/) - Streaming and screen/video recording software, open source.

## Support/Diagnostic
- [**WizTree**](http://antibody-software.com) - Disk space visualizer, stupid fast.
- [**HWiNFO**](https://hwinfo.com) - Comprehensive hardware analysis/monitoring
- [**Driver Identifier**](https://www.driveridentifier.com/) - find newer system drivers if absolutely necessary.
- [**Sandboxie**](https://www.sandboxie.com) - Isolate potentially pesky/untrusted applications, to be retired once Windows 10 built-in sandboxing UX has improved.
- [**CPU-Z**](https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html) - Hardware identification
- [**Process Monitor**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) - shows real-time file system, registry and process/thread activity. Not for the faint of heart. I recommend the checking out the entire [Sysinternals utilities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/) index for the various tools.
- [**Device Cleanup Tool**](https://www.uwe-sieber.de/misc_tools_e.html) - Remove non-present devices from Windows Device management

## Development
- [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - IDE
- [**Cmder**](http://cmder.net) - command prompt manager. Setup in quasi-Quake console mode.
- [**WinSCP**](https://winscp.net) - SFTP client
- [**Laravel Valet (Windows port)**](https://github.com/cretueusebiu/valet-windows) - PHP/Laravel development environment.

## Personal taste
- [**Dropbox**](https://www.dropbox.com) - Cloud storage, although I'm slowly transitioning to OneDrive/Business because the free version is becoming more and more limited (3 device maximum, constant notification regarding drive being "almost full").
- [**qBittorrent**](https://www.qbittorrent.org) - Extremely customizable torrenting application.
- [**Rainmeter**](https://www.rainmeter.net/) - Custom desktop widgets. I use it for my [World Clock](https://github.com/alystair/rainmeterWorldclock) and edited version of [Do I need a Jacket 2.0](https://flyinghyrax.deviantart.com/art/Do-I-Need-a-Jacket-2-0-beta-2016-04-10-494721790)

## Online services
- [**Spotify Premium**](http://spotify.com) - Music/podcast service. Premium because I hate ads and want to support artists.
- [**YouTube Premium**](https://www.youtube.com/premium) - I feel legally adblocking and supporting a service is critical to its long term sustainablity... with the drama that is happening on the platform maybe there will be a different option.
- [**SignNow**](https://www.signnow.com/) - E-signing service, Still with them due to grandfathered pricing, might build my own if I'm forced to pay full price.

## Android apps
- [Blackberry Hub](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blackberry.hub) / [Calendar](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blackberry.calendar) / [Contacts](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blackberry.contacts)

- [Twilight](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.lux) - active/passive screen hue control

## Physical gear
- **Headphones** - [Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro](https://www.beyerdynamic.com) 80ohm headphones - closed reference headphones with soft pads & readily available replacement pads/parts (Beyerdynamic rarely discontinues models unlike brands... like Audio Technica).
- **Mouse** - [SteelSeries Rival 500](https://steelseries.com/gaming-mice/rival-500). Oodles of physical buttons and doesn't compromise ergonomics. [See my detailed review here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MouseReview/comments/8jddq0/steelseries_rival_500_review_compared_to_logitech/) This mouse retired my Logitech G502 in May 2018.
- **Ballpoint pen** - [Zebra F-701 ballpoint Pen](https://www.zebrapen.com/product/f-701-ball-point-retractable/)
- **Measuring tape** - Used way more often than one would think!
- **Label printer** - Ancient [Dymo](http://www.dymo.com) LabelWriter, any model is fine.
- **Monitors** - one in landscape (1920x1080), another in in portrait (1200x1920). Can't go wrong with Dell.
- **Keyboard** - Wireless Logitech K520 (comes as combo with mouse which I never use). Practically placed media keys and pretty cheap. 
- **Bluetooth earbuds** - Anker SoundBuds Slim with custom eartips. Cheap, good frequency response and isolation. 

## Windows 7 only
- [**WizMouse**](http://antibody-software.com/web/software/software/wizmouse-makes-your-mouse-wheel-work-on-the-window-under-the-mouse/) - Allows mouse wheel to work on window under the cursor, even if it's out of focus.
- [**VirtualCloneDrive**](https://www.elby.ch/en/products/vcd.html) - Load ISO files directly, newer versions of Windows have this built-in.

## Retired
- [**Audio Switcher**](Change%20Audio.ahk) - replaced by SoundSwitch. File available for reference.
- [**KatMouse**](http://ehiti.de/katmouse/) - Scroll unfocused windows. Replaced by [WizMouse](http://antibody-software.com/web/software/software/wizmouse-makes-your-mouse-wheel-work-on-the-window-under-the-mouse/).
- **SpeedFan** - Monitors voltages, fan speeds and temperatures and check drive SMART status. Not updated actively so it has been mostly replaced by HWInfo
- **ScreenToGif** - replaced by LiceCAP. Editor UI is nice but the exported gifs are large.
- [**DisplayFusion**](https://www.displayfusion.com/) - Advanced wallpaper manager and misc. tweaks. No longer change my wallpaper frequently enough to care, although I do rarely use it to generate multi-monitor wallpaper.
- [**iRotate**](https://www.entechtaiwan.com/util/irotate.shtm) - Screen rotation hotkeys. I now have two monitors in both portrait & landscape, so I have no need for it anymore.
- [**WebMon**](https://alternativeto.net/software/webmon/) - discontinued web page monitoring program, used it for checking web comics for updates. Likely to be replaced by a Chrome extension.
- [**MediaMonkey**](http://www.mediamonkey.com/) - Absolutely incredible media library software. Highly customizable. When my media disks and backup failed catastrophically years ago I never had the time to get things back in order. Maybe I will someday, I enjoyed rating music I listened to on a 0-5 scale which online services can't do.
- **FullContact Address Book** - Android contact manager, now crapware. Avoid.
